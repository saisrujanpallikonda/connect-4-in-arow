## Introduction

Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which players choose a color and take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

This project aims to provide a digital implementation of the classic Connect 4 game for playing.

## Game Rules

Connect 4 follows simple rules:

1.The game is played on a grid that is 7 columns wide and 6 rows tall.
2.Two players take turns dropping their colored discs into the columns.
3.The discs fall to the lowest available slot in the selected column.
4.The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of 4 of your own discs.

## How to Play

Objective: The objective of Connect 4 is to be the first player to connect four of your own discs (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) on the game board.

Setup:

1.The game is played on a 7x6 grid, which means it has 7 columns and 6 rows.
2.Each player is assigned a color, typically red and yellow.
3.The game starts with an empty grid.

Gameplay:

1.Players take turns placing one of their colored discs into any of the 7 columns.
2.The disc will occupy the lowest available slot in the selected column.
3.Players cannot place their discs in a column that is already full.

Winning the Game:

The game can be won in three ways:

1.Horizontal: If a player manages to connect four of their discs horizontally in a row, they win.
2.Vertical: If a player forms a vertical line of four of their discs, they win.
3.Diagonal: Winning can also occur diagonally by connecting four discs diagonally across the grid.

Ending the Game:

1.The game ends when one player successfully connects four discs and wins.
2.If all columns are filled, and no player has connected four discs, the game is a draw.

Strategy Tips:

Pay attention to both your own moves and your opponent's moves. Try to create opportunities for yourself while blocking your opponent's potential winning moves.
Focus on building multiple potential winning sequences simultaneously.
Control the center column, as it allows for more opportunities to connect discs in various directions.
Be mindful of setting up traps for your opponent while avoiding falling into their traps.
